## üß© Project Overview

This group project explores the use of neural networks to model avalanche hazard forecasts using a 15-year dataset from the [Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS)](https://www.sais.gov.uk/). Our group has been assigned **Problem A**:  
> **Construct and evaluate a neural network model that predicts the *forecasted avalanche hazard* (FAH).**

The dataset includes daily avalanche forecasts and observations across six regions in Scotland, along with topographical, meteorological, and snowpack-related predictors.

---

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following variables:

- `Date`: Date of forecast  
- `Area`: One of six forecasting regions  
- `FAH`: Forecast Avalanche Hazard (target variable)  
- `OAH`: Observed Avalanche Hazard  
- **Predictor Set 1**: `longitude`, `Incline` (location/topography)  
- **Predictor Set 2**: `Air.Temp`, `Summit.Wind.Speed` (weather conditions)  
- **Predictor Set 3**: `Max.Temp.Grad`, `Snow.Temp` (snowpack integrity)

## üéØ Objectives

### Analytical Goals
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Create training, validation, and test splits
- Fit and evaluate neural network models
- Assess predictor importance and model performance

### Workflow Goals
- Collaborate effectively using GitHub (branches, pull requests)
- Render a reproducible scientific paper using Quarto
- Host the paper and supporting materials on GitHub Pages
- Critically assess the use of LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) in the workflow

---

## üìÅ Deliverables

1. **Scientific Report** (‚â§ 4500 words) hosted on GitHub Pages  
2. **Group Presentation** (20 minutes) for SAIS management  
3. **Amathuba Submission**:
   - `STUDENTID.txt`: Links to GitHub repo and website  
   - `STUDENTID.html`: Rendered scientific paper  
   - `STUDENTID.qmd`: Quarto source file with embedded resources

## ü§ñ Use of AI

We actively incorporate a large language model (LLM) to assist with:
- Code generation and debugging
- Report drafting and editing
- Prompt design and critical reflection on LLM performance

A dedicated webpage will document our LLM usage and evaluation.
